Team Win Recovery Project (TWRP) is an open-source software custom recovery image for Android-based devices. It provides a touchscreen-enabled interface that allows users to install third-party firmware and back up the current system which are functions often unsupported by stock recovery images. It is, therefore, often installed when flashing, installing, or rooting Android devices, although it isn't dependent on a device being rooted prior to installation.

In my view you have already enabled Developer Options and unlocked bootloader. Also you have ADB drivers installed.

Note: This is not a port and the recovery is built from Omni Source. So you will not faces any issues (atmost). Everything you do to your smartphone is your responsibility and we (and I) are here to help you. Follow instructions properly to customize your device.
